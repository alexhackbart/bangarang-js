This script was created to make it a little easier to organize our javascript functions. With it, we can easily add functions to execute on a per-page basis, all while keeping them in a single file.

Put it in the footer, right before the body tag closes. If you are including libraries like jQuery or plugins, make sure you do so above this script. Otherwise you'll be trying to run functions that don't exist yet.
